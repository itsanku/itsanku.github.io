    <h1>West Bengal Teacher Recruitment Scam & SSC Protest (2025)</h1>
    <p>Comprehensive Overview, Timeline, and Referenced Facts</p>

  <main>
    <h2>Background: The Recruitment Scam</h2>
    <p>
      In 2016, the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) conducted recruitment for 24,640 sanctioned teaching and non-teaching posts. However, 25,753 appointment letters were issued, raising suspicions of large-scale irregularities. Investigations revealed manipulation of OMR answer sheets, fabricated merit lists, and appointments allegedly secured through bribes, bypassing merit entirely.<sup>[6]</sup>
